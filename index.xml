      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong&gt;RoboSwift&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://swift.org/&#34;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; is a very promising language that many hope will replace other scripting languages like Python or Ruby. A year ago the language was made open source. Since then it has been ported to many different platforms, and there is hope that many people will learn it as a first language to build anything they can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this site we will explore the language through small projects in the field of robotics, automation, general DIY and electronics. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing&#34;&gt;Physical computing&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to learn and explore programming and engineering. We&amp;rsquo;ll build small projects that any maker can attempt at home, with only two requirements: Has to be fun, and it needs to use Swift as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates will be coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;
